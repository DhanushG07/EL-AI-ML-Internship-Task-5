# Heart Disease Prediction: Decision Tree & Random Forest

## Objective
Build classification models using Decision Tree and Random Forest to predict heart disease.

## Dataset
- Source: [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)
- `heart.csv`

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn
- Plot_tree (for visualization)

## Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning & EDA
2. Train-Test Split
3. Decision Tree Model & Visualization
4. Hyperparameter Tuning (max_depth)
5. Random Forest Model
6. Feature Importance Plot
7. Model Comparison using Accuracy & Cross-Validation

## Results
- Decision Tree Accuracy: ~[your_value]
- Random Forest Accuracy: ~[your_value]
- Random Forest outperformed Decision Tree and had better generalization.
